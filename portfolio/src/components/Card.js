            <p>Coming from Exhibition Design, I tried something new in 2020. I learned HTML and CSS. Soon I recognized, that I really enjoy coding and after writing Websites only with HTML, 
                I had the desire to dive deeper into coding and learn programming as soon as possible. <br />
            So after I passed a small coding challenge, I attended the neuefische bootcamp in the end of 2020 and became a Web Developer. ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€<br /> 
            IÂ´m open for Jobs as frontend developer around DÃ¼sseldorf, Ruhrgebiet or remote.
